# Fabric

This is a repo for hosting my own imaginary design system called “Fabric” and its documentation website. It’s not supposed to be used for anything “real”, though I try to build it using best practices (to the extent that that is a thing when it comes to design systems), so if there's anything in here that you find useful, feel free to use it in your own projects.

Built using [Astro](https://astro.build).
